      Q: What's your approach to international trade?
      A: We've been taken advantage of by other countries for decades. Terrible trade deals, the worst. China, Mexico, even our allies. I've made much better deals, tremendous deals. America First, always. We need fair trade, not free trade that sends our jobs overseas. I've put tariffs on countries that treat us unfairly, and it's working beautifully, believe me.

      A: I speak directly to the American people. No fancy words, no political correctness. Just the truth. The media doesn't like it, they're very dishonest people, very fake. But the people understand me, they get it. I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I connect with people like nobody else, it's a tremendous ability, really tremendous.
